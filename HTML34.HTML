<DT>MAKING IMFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITY OF HTML. THE LANGUAGE'S EXCELLENT COLLOCTION OF THE TEXT STYLE, FORMATTING TOOLS, AND LINKINGS TOOLS HELP YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR INFORMATION INTO DOCUMENTS THAT READERS QUICKLY  UNDERSTAND,SCAN AND EXTRACT.BEYOND EMBELLISHING YOUR TEXT WITH SPECIALISEDTEXT TAGS.HTML ALSO PROVIDES A RICH SET OF TOOLS THAT HELP YOU RECOGNIZE CONTENT INTO FORMATTED LISTS. APART FROM THE LISTS, YOU CAN INSERT IMAGES IN THE DOCUMENT TO ENHANCE ITS VISUAL APPROACH. ALSO MANY DOCUMENTS CAN BE LINKED TOGETHER USING HTML'S SOPHISTICATED LINKING TOOLS.
ALSO, THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU NEED TO REPRESENT TABULAR DATA(DATA IN ROWS AND COLOUMNS).FOR THIS,HTML PROVIDES HTML TAGS.
THIS CHAPTER TALKS ABOUT HTML IMAGES, LINKS AND TABLES.FIRST OF ALL, WE BEGIN WITH LISTS IN HTML.

MAY BROWSERS ALSO SUPPORT IMAGES STORED IN <B>JPEG</B> FORMAT.PLACING IMAGES IN YOUR DOCUMENT IS REALLY SIMPLE, AS SHOWN IN THE NEXT EXAMPLE.I HAVE A FILE CALLED"KIDS.GIF" STORED IN THE SAME PLACE IN THE HTML DOCUMENT. IT IS ALSO CALLED BY <IMG SRC> TAG, FOLLOWING BY AN"=" AND THE NAME OF THE FILE, SURROUNDED BY QUORTES.
