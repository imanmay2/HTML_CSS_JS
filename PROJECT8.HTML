THE ATMOSPHERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS AROUND US EVERYDAY. EVERYDAY GASES ARE RELEASED INTO THE AIR BY ALL LIVING MATERIAL. THE GASES IN THE AIR ARE USED FOR MANY IMPORTANT THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, HYDROGEN IS RELEASED  BY VOLCANOES,
WHICH CAN GIVE ENERGY TO THE CELL; PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAS EVOVLED TO TAKE THE GAS CARBON DIOXIDE AND CREATE FOOD AND RELEASE OXYGEN; NITROGEN IS A GAS USED IN OUR AIR, OCEANS AND SOLID EARTH, AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF LIVING THINGS.<BR>
CARBON DIOXIDE IS ALSO INVOLVD IN PROCESSES WHERE ITIS STORED AS LIMESTONE AND MARBLE, AS GAS AND OIL AND COAL , AND IS IN ORGANIC MATERIAL IN THE SOIL. NOT ONLY DO THESE GASES MAKE UP  OUR ATMOSPHERE, BUT THEY ALSO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH STABLE. CARBON DIOXIDE
ABSORBS THE RADIATION THAT WOULD OTHERWISE ESCAPE THE EARTH. BY ADDING OXGEN AND TAKING OUT CARBON DIOXIDE THIS CAUSES THE EARTH TO BE COOLER THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE.<BR>
THESE ARE JUST TWO OF THE MANY GASES THAT MAKE UP THE ATMOSPHERE WE LIVE IN TODAY. THE TEMPEATURE IN OUR EARTH IS DIRECTLY DETERMINED BY THESE FIVE GASES. EVEN THOUGH THE CAUSES OF GLOBAL WARMING ARE KNOWN, THE EXACT  EFFECTS IT WILL HAVE ON US THE FUTURE ARE YET TO BE DETERMINED.
