ENERGY CONSERVATION REFERS TO THE REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION THROUGH USING LESS OF AN ENERGY SERVICE.
ENERGY CONSERVATION DIFFERS FROM EFFICIENT ENERGY USE, WHICH REFERS TO USING LESS ENERGY FOR A CONSTANT
SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, DRIVING LESS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ENERGY CONSERVATION. DRIVING THE SAME AMOUNT WITH
A HIGHER MILEAGE VEHICLE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ENERGY EFFIENCY.<BR>
ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFIENCY ARE BOTH ENERGY REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. EVEN THOUGH ENERGY
CONSERVATION REDUCES ENERGY SERVICE, IT CAN RESULT IN INCREASED, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, NATIONAL 
SECURITY, AND PERSONAL FINANCIAL SECURITY. IT IS AT THE TOP OF THE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY HIEARCHY.<BR>
